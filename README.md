🎬 Movie Rating Prediction with Python

This project builds a machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, actors, and other attributes. The goal is to analyze historical movie data, identify key factors that influence ratings, and develop a regression-based model to estimate ratings given by users or critics.

📌 Project Overview

Movie ratings are influenced by multiple factors including genre, cast, crew, and production details. By applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression techniques, we aim to:

Understand the factors that impact movie ratings

Build predictive models for movie rating estimation

Provide insights into what makes a movie well-received

📂 Dataset

The dataset typically includes:

MovieID – Unique identifier

Title – Name of the movie

Genre – Type of movie (Action, Drama, Comedy, etc.)

Director – Director of the movie

Actors – Main cast

ReleaseYear – Year of release

Budget – Movie budget

Revenue – Box office revenue

Rating – Target variable (IMDb / user rating out of 10)

⚙️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy → Data handling

matplotlib, seaborn → Visualization

scikit-learn → ML models & evaluation

nltk / scikit-learn → Text preprocessing

🔎 Approach

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values (e.g., missing budget/revenue)

Encode categorical variables (Genre, Director, Actors)

Feature scaling for numerical values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of ratings

Correlation of budget, revenue, genre with rating

Top directors/actors influencing high ratings

Feature Engineering

Create features like number of genres, actor popularity score, director track record

Normalize skewed numerical features (Budget, Revenue)

Model Training

Apply regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization

Evaluation

Metrics: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), R² Score

Cross-validation for robustness
